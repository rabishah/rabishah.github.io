            <p><a href="http://lab.fortystones.com/nepaliunicode/">Shree (श्री) Nepali Unicode</a> is our first lab project for fortystones. We started this project in our fourth semester break and completed it in 7 days. Our main objective was to create a Firefox addon which would allow user to transliterate in Nepali wherever he/she wants. For instance, if you are using Facebook chat, the addon would transliterate your message to Nepali. The addon is almost complete and we will soon be launching our first Firefox addon.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in creating a firefox extension, I think these sites will be of great help.</p>

            <p>Initially, I was clueless as where to start off.   Me and Prashish ( my project partner ) , both of us, were constantly googling articles, grasping basic ideas, implementing them for hours. Finally, we concluded that we had to code in JavaScript (for algos and the project itself)  and understand how to use XUL, XML etc for the Firefox addon.  On the bright side Prashish had prior knowledge of JavaScript and a perect time for me to get along with Javascript. My prior knowledge of OOP concepts boosted my confidence in learning JavaScript.</p>

            <p>As usual, we had to overcome simple yet important issues while coding & designing. However difficult it seemed to us, we were able to conquer them in the end and yes, a proud moment for both of us when we launched it.</p>

            <p>I did realize from this project that however difficult any project may seem, if you try it, you will complete it, if not, at least end up learning something new.</p>

            <p>Hey, if you want to improve the current version of Shree or have any innovative ideas, feel free to contact me.</p>
