             <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>Two mothers living in the same house, each the mother of an infant son, came to Solomon. One of the babies had died, and each claimed the remaining boy as her own. Calling for a sword, Solomon declared his judgment: the baby would be cut in two, each woman to receive half. One mother did not contest the ruling, declaring that if she could not have the baby then neither of them could, but the other begged Solomon, <em>‚ÄúGive the baby to her, just don‚Äôt kill him!‚Äù</em></p>

              <p>The king declared the second woman the true mother, as a mother would even give up her baby if that was necessary to save its life. This is the story of the Judgment of Solomon. The story of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Solomon" target="_blank">The Judgment of Solomon</a></em>. It is a fascinating tale and for some odd reasons, I reference it with myself and feel fortunate to be a part of a happy family and friends I forged over the years.</p>

              <p>I was born in Janakpur, brought up in Kathmandu and currently residing in Bengaluru. I have not met anyone who does not like to travel, or ice cream for the same matter. If you don‚Äôt like either of them, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:rabi@27ae60.com">rabi@27ae60.com</a>. I will treat you with a beer. Also, ping me if you are an Arsenal fan. An Arsenal match is best watched in a group along with a Tottenham fan ;)</p>

              <p>I am a programmer by profession and a comrade of Team 27AE60. As of now, I am working on a product called, <a href="http://chapiapp.com">Chapi - save anything from the web</a>ü§û</p>
