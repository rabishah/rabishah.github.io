             <p>Unlike Sheldon, I can’t say  “Good morning everyone and welcome to “Science and Society”. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD and ScD. OMG, right? ”  Nevertheless, I am a student pursuing my Under Graduate in Information Technology (IT) in Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad, India.</p>

             <p>Well, I feel everyone has something to say. People like Steve Jobs, Richard Stallman, Linus Trovalds,  Mark Shuttleworth,  Bill Gates are followed for what they have to say and students like me always find inspirations in their thoughts.  Then we seek blogs to ponder our opinions and views.</p>

             <p>I mean, in this fascinating world of Google, Facebook, You Tube and Twitter,  information is always within reach. So with this blog, i will be sharing all my experience, skills and views on Current happenings and stuffs that i know (all related to my subject)</p>

            <p>And I hope you will be following my blog.</p>
