           <h3 class="mbtm-none">Into Google APIs</h3>
           <div>June 16, 2011,<em> 1 min read</em></div>

           <p>As soon as I open Firefox or Chrome (IE ðŸ˜¦), the first thing that comes to my mind is Google. It so happens that I open Google without any intention of opening it. In fact I totally agree that Google must be credited for its Search engine. However, we all must know that apart from Google mail, Google Search Engine,and recent Android development, there are Google APIs which will amuse you. For e.g. Google Maps, Google Earth, AdSense and YouTube.</p>

           <p>I mean, being an IT student, playing with Google API is so much of fun. You can find more information in Google Code. Most of the Google APIs are only available in beta version but it would naturally save you a lot of time, if you had to code it from its very initial phase. ðŸ˜‰</p>
           
           <p>Therefore, you just need to Register for yourself and then get started with Documentation, Blog, Group, Lab of those APIs.
