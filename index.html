            <p class="Greetings"><em>Hi ðŸ‘‹</em></p>
            <p>
                My close friends call me Ghomes. My mom calls me Bittu and you can call me Rabi (ruh - bee).
                I believe each one of us has unique story to tell and experiencesto share.

                This is the Year of the Rooster and it all started in 1990  for me, the year I was
                born. I spent almost 19 years in Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, didnâ€™t travel
                a lot during the time but I found happiness whenever I stumbled upon new places / towns
                and shops in Kathmandu itself. This might be a reason why, I love travelling and travelling
                with friends. Also, I think <a href="http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/regional/kyoto/">Kyoto</a> is an
                amazing place to be, but not alone.

                As long as I can remember, my infatuations with computer started with Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS).
                I owned a floppy disk (1.44mb) with three files in it: io.sys, msdos.sys and command.com.  And these were
                the only files that were required for operations. It was an interesting discovery for me as there was no
                signs of Internet in my neighbor hood.  Over the years, at least to me, the notion that human beings can
                achieve anything got more vivid when I came across Windows 3.1 (the first Graphical User Interface I had
                ever seen), compact discs, printers, dramatic increase in storage, games and peripheral devices such as
                mouse, image scanners, microphones, webcams.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I would say, I chose my career as a web developer when I had a dial up connection setup for
                Internet at my home.  The sound it made got me hooked to my personal computer. Any new sites, I
                discovered was like a Pokedex. You would have the Yahoo Messenger, Mini clip games, Netscape navigator
                and many more. Internet was / is fun.  Maybe, this might also be a reason, why I want to make / build
                applications so, any person, who ever comes across my inventions should bring smile or rather find
                it interesting.

                As of 2017, Iâ€™ve been dedicating most of my time to <a href="http://chapiapp.com">Chapi</a>. Itâ€™s a personal endeavor Iâ€™ve undertaken
