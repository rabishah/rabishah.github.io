            <h3 class="mbtm-none">Mini C Compiler using Yacc & Flex</h3>
            <div>April 25, 2012,<em> 1 min read</em></div>
            
            <p>Last month, we were given a project to develop a mini C Compiler using Yacc & Flex.Last week,  I had this silly assumption  that I would somehow manage it from the net.  And on the final day before our assignment was due for submission, I was like “Why didn’t I start coding a week before?”.</p>

            <p>In the end, when I was ready with code for submission, I was happy with my effort  although I could have modified  to include advanced features. Nevertheless its a simple and  a basic code for the beginners in Yacc & Flex.</p>

            <p>Here’s a link in Github: <a href="https://github.com/rabishah/Mini-C-Compiler-using-Flex-And-Yacc" target="_blank">Mini-C-Compiler</a></p>

            <p>If you have any doubt, feel free to comment or mail me your doubts.</p>
